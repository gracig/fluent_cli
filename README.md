## Installation

To set up Fluent CLI on your local system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fluent-cli.git
   ```
   
3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fluent-cli
   ```
4. Build the project using Cargo (Rust's package manager):
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

   ## Or Install Directly
   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/njfio/fluent_cli.git
   ```

## Configuration

If you have never used amber before, we need to start with it.  If you use amber just add the keys to your existing vault. 

Running `amber init` will create an `amber.yaml` file in the current directory and output your onetime private key.  

Do not lose this file or you will be unable to unlock the amber secrets file and run fluent.

> ## Securely store that secret key, such as in a password manager. Additionally, if desired, put that secret key in your CI system's secrets.

```bash
amber init                                                                                      
Your secret key is: 9d75ea642ed27900624b30de2e0f5ed979104d098918db92e50a9aa6f2a57952
Please save this key immediately! If you lose it, you will lose access to your secrets.
Recommendation: keep it in a password manager
If you're using this for CI, please update your CI configuration with a secret environment variable
export AMBER_SECRET=9d75ea642ed27900624b30de2e0f5ed979104d098918db92e50a9aa6f2a57952
```

## Adding keys to amber

Below is a starter table of keys for the included configs.  It also includes links to get all API keys from the various services. 

It's incredibly easy to use.  Just get your api key from whatever service and run the command in the amber command column replacing the <content> with your key.  
The `AMBER_ANOTHERWEBSERVICE_NJF` example includes the bearer token for the service.

Fluent CLI relies on a JSON configuration file to manage the workflow specifics. Ensure that the `FLUENT_CLI_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is set to point to your configuration file.  Use the included configuration file, `config.json` to start.  

There are plenty of working chatflows publically available that will function correctly once your api keys are in amber.   

Example of setting an environment variable:
```bash
export FLUENT_CLI_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/your/config.json"
export AMBER_YAML='/path/to/amber.yaml'
```
